{"defid":"2184209","definition":"     A native Chicago punk rock / hardcore / [melodycore] band, currently consisting of [Tim McIlrath], Joe Principe, [Brandon Barnes], and Chris Chasse. Rise Against, under the label of [Fat Wreck] Cords, released their first two albums, The Unraveling (2001) and Revolutions Per Minute (2003).  These two albums were recieved well, though considerably more hardcore and punk than many of Fat Wreck Cords other more pop punk signs.\r\n     Rise Against then switched labels to Dreamworks / [Universal Music Group] / Geffen Records to release [Siren Song] of the Counter Culture (2004).  This new album delivered a far less hardcore sound, but was undeniably intense and far more accessible to the mainstream public.  SSotCC was criticized by many saying that Rise Against had \"Lost their punk rock roots...\" etc etc. And while they had indeed drifted, though not entirely, from their original \"slam it and scream \u0027em\" roots, Rise Against had shown in SSotCC with songs like Tip the Scales and Dancing for Rain --and would show in their upcoming album, The Sufferer and the Witness-- that they were still very much in the punk rock scene, even if they had taken a different style.  This style is what many have come to call melodycore.\r\n     After the large and mainstream success of SSotCC from such songs as Life Less Frightening, Give It All, and [Swing Life Away], Rise Against released a re-edited version of The Unraveling via Fat Wreck Cords in 2005.  They then began working on their new, deeper, and darker album, The Sufferer and The Witness (2006).  TSatW had success with such songs as Ready To Fall and [Prayer of the Refugee], ranking high on the US modern rock boards.  This new album from rise against had still the political unrest of previous records, but it also had a deeper focus on personal and emotional upheaval.  With TSatW Rise Against screamed of how humanity was killing ourselves, and simply knowing the problem wasn\u0027t enough in songs like Ready To Fall. They sang of heartbreak and disillusionment in songs such as Approaching Curve or Roadside.  And true to their nature, they scream their political discord in songs like Bricks or [Built to Last] (a bonus track).\r\n     Rise Against is known for their delivery of hardcore rock and punk influences to the mainstream audience with melody (hence the term melodycore).  Though critics may blindly sling [empty insults] about their sound and themes, their success, music, and musical content is the only counter-point needed to disregaurd such accusations.

{"defid":"2827610","definition":"The fundamental motivation for humans.  Lucifer fell from Heaven in his attempt to become God--the [ultimate power] grab.  Lucifer, as Satan, acting through the Serpent, suggested to Adam and Eve (the first humans created by God in his image) that they could become God luring them into rebellion him.  Following the pattern set by their original parents, all humans are driven by a desire to be God.  \r\n\r\nHumans, now in a fallen condition, are continually trying to one up each other. Even members of one\u0027s own family or friends attempt to gain power over each other.  As [Nietzsche] pointed out, virtually all human behavior is motivated by the \"[Will to Power].\"  Nature even rewards people with more power as they live longer, feel happier, and have higher levels of [serotonin] in their brain. People band together in an attempt to dominate other groups even more thoroughly. Wars, racism, economic competition, cutting remarks at parties, domestic violence can all be traced back to the urge to dominate others.  \r\n\r\nSubtly, even attempts to [equalize] wealth, income, social status, racial disparities are attempts by those without power to pull down and dominate those who are currently in power.  Equality of result is motivated by resentment and envy.  Efforts to equalize people\u0027s conditions are movements by those who are presently less powerful to gain power over those who have dominated them.  Many times these less powerful people are aided by those with power who feel guilty that they have power but then assume power over the minorities they claim to help.  For example, witness the recent assertion by the [Clintons] that Martin Luther King and the black leadership in the [Civil Rights Movement] were not as effective in actually achieving their social goals until their cause was [championed] by white leftist liberals such as [LBJ] and themselves--meaning in clear language--shut up, stay in your place, and do not vote for that uppity Barack Obama.\r\n\r\nThe desire for power makes the entire project of the Left an impossibility.  People are selfish, sadistic, and power-crazy.  This urge for dominance will never change until the world as we know it ends. There is no exception in human history to hierarchy and inequality.  A more reasonable goal is to limit those in power and induce them to serve the common good as [classical liberalism] sought to do.

{"defid":"191664","definition":"A style of music started in the mid-1970\u0027s by the seminal \"band\" [Throbbing Gristle]. Known for the painful noise and disturbed subject matter that seemed to spring eternal from their seriously crazed leader, Genesis P-Orridge (he was once threatened by the axe-murder [Ian Brady]... Prompting him to write a song about Ian), TG quickly claimed a name for itself. They were often described as \"[the wreckers] of civilization.\" Industrial music was further explored by synth-whatever acts Suicide and Cabaret [Voltaire], from New York and Sheffield respectively. Both shared a sort of skewed love for pop music, and both had a penchant for writing seriously weird songs, in the tradition of TG. Cab Voltaire especially was an enormous influence on the scene to follow. The Cabs were soon followed by the fledgling [Einsturzende Neubauten], possibly the most notorious of the well-known industrial groups. With more members, no drum set, and a hatred for the guitar, [Blixa Bargeld] and his band of jaded Germans unleashed a wave of broken machinery and really cool-sounding German lyrics, and throwing in danceable beats, thus giving birth to (you can\u0027t blame \u0027em) the Holocaust that is modern-day industrial. With very little respect for the experimentation of their forefathers but a strong desire to somehow work machinery into their music, a whole host of over (I will NOT say über)-angsty Goths turned to the new genre of Industrial for sanctuary. Bands like Skinny Puppy, KMFDM, and many other groups who wore their hair like Goths but were really, REALLY angry, started coming out of the woodwork. J.G. Thirlwell was a notable exception, bringing some seriously needed humour to the genre with his whole host of aliases (most of them containing \"foetus\"). Things only went downhill from there, and before you know it, BAM! the Nine Inch Nails.","example":"[Just because] it has the sound of a [jackhammer] in it doesn\u0027t make it [industrial music].","permalink":"http://industrial.urbanup.com/191664","word":"industrial"}

{"defid":"733121","definition":"What is speed? Speed is amphetamine, a stimulating drug that triggers the brain’s reward system giving the user feelings of pleasure. Speed also goes by the street names “Ice, Crystal meth and [Shabu]” 2 The drug works using [Dopamine]. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is used in all matters of the brain from learning to attentiveness. However, the most prominent usage of [dopamine] is to incite the brain’s reward system. Dopamine is released in the brain naturally when people eat, drink and have sex. 1 Dopamine is released into the [synaptic] space in between the pre and postsynaptic [neurons]. Here is where speed comes in. Speed’s goal (Speed doesn’t really have a goal it merely exists, but this is the reason people use it) is to trigger a buildup of Dopamine. Speed first enters the Terminal Button in one of several ways. Speed is very similar on a [molecular] level to Dopamine so Speed can enter the Dopamine [transporter] or speed can [diffuse] into the [neuron]. The amphetamine then expels the dopamine out into the synaptic space. It does this through a process that forces the Dopamine transporters to go in reverse. Under natural circumstances Dopamine is brought back into the terminal button through the Dopamine reuptake pumps. These pumps do not work as well when speed is present in the brain and the Dopamine remains longer as a result. “Speed also inhibits monoamine oxydase A (MAO-A).”1 Speed also forces glutamate to come into the synaptic space. The result of this is dopamine will flow more easily. \r\n\tThe effects people notice with amphetamines make it clear why the drug has earned the name speed. Speed makes everything go faster. When on the drug, which can be taken in forms of powder, pills and injections, “your heart rate… blood pressure and movements all increase in speed.” 2 It also makes sleep difficult.  The size of the user’s pupils increase and weight loss becomes easier. While the user is “high” off the drug he or she can expect “to feel good, be more willing to take risks and be excited”.2 Speed’s long-term effects are for the most part similar to many other drugs. Speed causes depression, personal problems, anger and violence. Speed is also addicting. There is one more side effect that is more unique to the drug. This side effect is coined [psychosis]. [Psychosis] is a serious psychological problem. People that suffer from it hear voices in their head, become delusional and paranoid. Psychosis victims are known to see things that aren’t there and often feel that ordinary objects and people want to hurt them.4. In [Requiem for a Dream] a movie about [the downward spiral] instigated by drugs, An elder widow is prescribed [diet pills], which are speed. When she becomes addicted she believes her refrigerator is trying to kill her.3 Amphetamines although possibly more enjoyable then other drugs also negatively affect you sooner. 3 [Fevers], heart attacks and death are all possible results of the use of speed.2","example":"With a few [grams] a speed in [you you] could write all that [in 5 minutes]","permalink":"http://speed.urbanup.com/733121","word":"speed"}

While [bouldering] can require extreme amounts of strength and control, it is relatively safe, because the only danger comes from landing incorrectly\r\n\r\nTop-roping is the form of climbing most commonly thought about when someone hears the word \"rock climbing\" it involves the rope going up from the climber, through an anchor setup at the top of [the climb], and back down to the [belayer]. it is the safest, and [best kind] of climbing for beginners, because the potential for long falls is almost completely eliminated. \r\n\r\nSport climbing is done by climbers who \"lead\" up rocks that are pre-drilled with bolts. Climbers clip \"draws\" into the bolts then clip the rope through the draw. More dangerous than toproping because when you fall, you fall twice the distance between you and the last bolt. Lead climbing is the only recognized form of \"true\" ascents. \r\n\r\n[Trad] climbing, or \"traditional\" climbing is the origional kind of climbing. It starts with the climbers and their gear that the bottom of a cliff, and then they go up, the leader fixes placements, then the second follows and \"cleans\" the gear, or removes it from the rock. Very difficult climbing due to the fact that one has to place gear with one hand while hanging on to the rock with the other.

If this is the case then neither person needs to account for their time or actions to the other person in relation to any part of the \"break\" even after the break is over.

{"defid":"2941929","definition":"A fictional race of [Argonimorphic] apes, presented in books, movies, tales and in the real life. Humans are warm-blooded, soft-skinned, flat-faced, ugly mammals, who tent to make things that are [beautiful ugly].  The apes are rather unintelligent (the average intelligence [quotient] is 100), their main obsessions are domination, copulation (population over 6.600.000.000 and is still growing, it probably will until the apes run out of food, this obsession can also leads to deviations, which is some sort of a psyche [decease] or highly dangerous side effect), social integration (the more friends they have - the better it is). They are treacherous, best not to trust them. The aggression level is so high that they can\u0027t get on without killing each other, every excuse is good to start a military conflict, or at least humiliate the opposing side and show one\u0027s domination over the other side. Also, humans are very weird, for example, in a face to face contact to communicate you have not only use words, but also mimics, [gesticulation] and the so called, overall \"body language\". All in all, they have a tendency for over expression of their feelings, yet sometimes they seem to have no real feelings at all or have extremely shallow feelings. Some of them also believe in \"faith\", which is a thing that serves as an excuse for their mistakes and wrong life decisions. Most of the human governments, if not all of them, are [Kleptocratic]. \r\n\r\nHumans also have very weird sense of beauty, they consider ugly things (for example: snow mountains) as \"breath taking\". In most cases they can\u0027t even use the simplest logic. Paradoxically, everything in their life must be in a perfect order, everything must have a number, a name, every single item has its very own place in their homes, work places or wherever. They also like lots of entertainment and they can\u0027t remain serious when required. It is also worth noticing that in the human societies the [Emotional Quotient] (also known as [EQ], also known as inter personal intelligence or [emotional intelligence]) is far more important than the actual Intelligence [Quotient], in other words: it\u0027s better if you are charming than if you are intelligent. Humans have created over 3.000 languages and there are more than two hundred countries. The reason why humans don\u0027t want to unite is unknown, although they use excuses such as \"culture\", \"languages\" and few other things. In human societies being cynical is perceived as a disadvantage, a bad element of personality. Humans are also very ignorant and arrogant. \r\n\r\nA very good example of their ignorance is fiction they create. For some unknown reasons they think that other sentient races - if they, of course, exist, are exactly same as them.

{"defid":"959518","definition":"An economic system based on private ownership of the means of production, in which personal bling can be acquired through investment of capital and employment of peeps. Capitalism is grounded in the concept of fo\u0027 real enterprise, which argues that the man\u0027s intervention in the economy should be restricted and that a free market, based on [supply and demand], will ultimately maximize consumer dough. These principles were most notably pwned in [Adam Smith\u0027s] [treatise], [The Wealth of Nations] (1776), in which he opposed the prevailing theory of [mercantilism]. Capitalism has existed in a limited form in the economies of all hoods, but its modern importance dates at least from the Industrial Revolution  that began in the 18th century, when bankers, merchants, playas and industrialists (the bourgeoisie) began to displace landowners in political, economic, and social importance, particularly in Great Britain. Capitalism stresses freedom of individual economic enterprise; however, government action has been and is required to curb its playa-hating, which have ranged from slavery (particularly in Britain and the United States), [haxors](In Diablo and CS servers), and [apartheid] (in South Africa) to monopoly cartels and financial fraud. Capitalism does not presuppose a specific form of social or political organization-type shit: the [democratic socialism] of the Scandinavian states, the consensus politics of Japan, and the state-sponsored rapid industrial growth of South Korea while under military pwnage all coexist with capitalism. Yet despite the capitalist ideal of “hands-off” government, significant government 1337ness has existed in most capitalist nations at least since the Great Depression in the 1930s. In the United States, it exists in the form of subsidies, tax credits, incentives, free hours of AOL, and other types of exemptions. Though private production plays a major role in the economies of Germany and Japan, both nations have centrally planned industrial policies in which bankers, industrialists, playas, pimps, hos and [labor unions] meet and seek to agree to wage policies and interest rates; these countries reject the idea of letting the bling wholly determine the economy. The collapse of the Soviet Union and its fugly states in Eastern Europe (1989-91) left those countries with a heavy burden, much shit, and an uncertain future, representing a substantial retreat in the power of [capitalism\u0027s] traditional economic opponent, socialism. Also uncertain is the future course of China\u0027s economy, in which small-scale capitalism is increasingly allowed within a strictly Communist political deal.","example":"Joe: I think Capitalism is a [sham] and can seriously hurt countries economically\r\nTim: GET OUT OF MY SIGHT YOU LIBERAL [PINKO] [COMMIE]!","permalink":"http://capitalism.urbanup.com/959518","word":"Capitalism"}

{"defid":"3738435","definition":"The DOLLAR is a unit of measurement, same as a pound, ounce, inch, foot, yard, [acre], mile, etc. Units of measure do not change only the number of units or the value of the units of measure change.The DOLLAR is a form of measurement, not money. A Dollar is 90% pure [silver] ([412].5 [grains] in weight) or 90% [pure gold] (25.8 grains). A DOLLAR of silver weighs the same as ten silver dimes, or four silver quarters, or two silver halves.\r\n\r\nTHE TERM DOLLAR HAS BEEN DEFINED SEVERAL WAYS:\r\n\r\n“A silver coin” Webster’s [Encyclopedic] Dictionary, 1980.\r\n\r\n“A weight of gold or silver” Encyclopedia Britannica, 1962.\r\n\r\n“412.5 grains of silver” World Dictionary, 1959.\r\n\r\nThe Century Dictionary, Published [1914] (with over 8,000 pages of definitions) defines the term DOLLAR as “The monetary unit or standard of value of the United States and Canada. By the term Dollar in the United States is intended the coined dollar of the United States, a certain quantity in weight and fineness of gold or silver…”[Silver] Certificates state the following: “This certifies that there is on deposit in the Treasury of the United States of America (denomination) Dollar(s) in silver payable to the [bearer] [on demand].”\r\n\r\nUnited States Notes states the following: \r\n\r\n“The United States of America will pay to the bearer on demand (denomination) Dollar(s).” \r\n\r\nA NOTE cannot be a DOLLAR, it can only be a promise to pay.\r\n\r\nConstitutional Requirement:\r\n\r\nThe United States Constitution only permits coined money to be used to pay debts.\r\n\r\nArticle 1, Section 10, paragraph 1, The United States Constitution:\r\n\r\nNo State shall make any thing but [gold and silver] coin a tender in payment of debts….\r\n\r\n[Coinage] Act of [April 2], 1792:\r\n\r\nThe money of account of the United States shall expressed in dollars or units…all accounts in public and all proceedings in the courts of the United States shall kept and had in conformity to this regulation.\r\nPaper [receipts] for gold and silver are no longer issued by the United States.\r\n\r\nBesides the denominations of United States notes, from $1 to $10,000, that were issued before 1929, several other types of United States paper receipts no longer issued have circulated within the past 75 years. [National Bank] notes were issued by national banks from 1863 to 1929. Gold certificates, [authorized] in [1865] and issued by the Treasury Department in exchange for [gold coin] and [bullion], circulated until [1933]. Silver certificates, authorized in 1878 and issued in exchange for dollars of silver, accounted for nearly all of the $1 notes in circulation until November [1963], when the first $1 [Federal Reserve] notes without the “Will Pay To The [Bearer] [On Demand]” notation were issued as money.\r\n\r\nWhich one is the real Money? \r\n\r\nThe Federal Reserve Note without the “Will Pay To The Bearer On Demand” removed was first issued in November 1963. It claims to be Five Dollars.\r\n\r\nA Note is a promise to pay. It cannot be money.The United States Note that was issued before November 1963 was redeemable [for Five Dollars]. If it was redeemable for Five Dollars, it could not be the Five Dollars. \r\n\r\nReal Money is for example a [1913] Dollar of Silver (412.5 grains of silver in weight)AKA the Morgan Dollar of Silver.\r\n\r\nThe paper money we use every day are Federal Reserve Notes ([FRN]), not Dollars as we commonly call them. The FRNs are no longer receipts for “Dollars” or “Dollars of Silver”. If a FRN is not redeemable for “Dollars” what is it worth? It is worth what you believe it is worth, since you can still use it to buy things, it has a value. But what is it costing you to use FRNs that are not backed by something tangible (like gold or silver) to control its worth? Since there is nothing controlling the actual number of FRNs printed, an unlimited amount can be produced. As in any market, the value of anything goes down if there is more of the item available to be consumed. \r\n\r\nThere is a way to place a value on a FRN by comparing it to the value of a Dollar of Silver.\r\n \r\nAs of Oct. 18, 2008 the NYMEX closing price of silver was at 9.32 FRNs per troy ounce of silver. Each Morgan Dollar contains 0.7735 troy ounces of silver. This translates to a value of 7.21 FRNs for each Morgan Dollar. Transversely, the value of a FRN is about 13.7 cents. \r\n\r\nThis is why things cost so much. The FRNs we call Dollars only have the buying power of 13.7 cents.\r\n\r\nToday’s [FEDERAL RESERVE]* (Private Corporation with Federal Controls) NOTES are not redeemable for silver or gold. They survive by our faith only. We should always have faith, but to own a dollar of silver it takes 7.21 FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","example":"[dollar bill]","permalink":"http://dollar.urbanup.com/3738435","word":"dollar"}
